# Snow

Welcome to the Snowday codebase. This project currently does not build, we are passively working on getting that resolved. The project has been on ice/dead for a couple years now and we don't entirely remember where we left off. If you're interested in actually getting it running and this disclaimer is still here in the README, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Dr-Jerm/Snow/issues/new) and that will light a bigger fire under our butt to get it stable.
